**Employees Analysis**<br>
<br>
*Project Description:*<br>
The following is a research project about people whom a company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.<br>
<br>
This project contains tables to hold data from CSV files, imports CSV files into a SQL database, and then answers questions about the data (showcasing data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis).<br>
<br>
	1. List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.<br>
	2. List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.<br>
	3. List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.<br>
	4. List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.<br>
	5. List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.<br>
	6. List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.<br>
	7. List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.<br>
	8. List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).<br>
